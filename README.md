Data Analysis in Python: Using Regular Expressions on WhatsApp Messages

It probably happened before: You opened your WhatsApp and read a lot of “good morning”, “good evening” and “good afternoon” messages through a lot of groups.
Now, suppose you want to visualize the messages of this group in order to achieve more insight about, for example, the number of messages from someone, or what day had the most number of messages, or, in this case, discover how many “good morning”- in a specific WhatsApp group. How does one do that?

I used regular expression and pandas to generate more insights

The data is acquired from a  WhatsApp group chat, exported through the app.
